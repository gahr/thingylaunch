thingylaunch
============

Simple X11 application launcher.

This project is a complete rewrite of the original thinglaunch by Matt Johnston.

Thingylaunch has been enhanced with the following features:

* XCB backend
* tab-completion
* history navigation, with the UpArrow and DownArrow keys
* bookmarks, activated by `Alt+char`, loaded from the ~/.thingylaunch.bookmarks file, which consists of lines structured as `char command`
* command line arguments
